Spotify Mood App

by Sean D & Bryam V

OVERVIEW

This app allows users to login or signup to our app, with their username and user_id being saved into our sql database. From there, users can choose a mood for a song that they would like to listen to. Users will be fed the song url and name, which they can then load into spotify web player. Users can choose to save a song which will be added to a UserSong join_table. Users can also delete an instance from the join table as well. Users cannot update song information, but they can update their username, and view songs associated with their profile.
